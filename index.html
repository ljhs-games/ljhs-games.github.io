<p>LJHS Games began under the name of Linux Programming club in late 2017 with the start of a new school year at <a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/schools/la-jolla">La Jolla High School</a>, with Cameron Reikes as its founder. Later in the year the name switched to Viking Games and the logo switched to a viking wearing sunglasses, all in the effort of making the club more inviting so new members would join. As the founder was the only one with previous projects and therefore the ability to create games under his belt, it was very difficult for much to get done. Club based teaching sessions began even later in the school season, but it did little to help. Teaching by pushing information is very innefficient, the only real way for somebody to learn something quickly and learn it for life is to for them to be self propelled. This was a lesson sadly learned too late. By the end of the year, the club didn't have a single real release. In the beginning and end of that school year, no matter the name, very little got done in the club, due to a variety of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor membership participation</li>
<li>Too many members, organizational overhead</li>
<li>Lack of skill</li>
<li>Not enough time devoted to the club</li>
</ul>
<p>However, with the coming of the new school year, came a new attitude from its founder that was focused on making the maximum amount of great games in the shortest time possible. The club membership was forcibly cut down by a factor of %90, with only the skilled members who were passionate about their work remaining. The new slimmed down team was a near immediate success. By enrolling the club into the weekly competition, the <a href="http://weeklygamejam.com/">Weekly Game Jam</a>, 6 games that were at the very least playable were made and can be viewed now on the <a href="https://ljhsgames.itch.io/">club's itch page</a>. Right now, we are focused on a flagship open source multiplayer strategy game called Naval Battle. Release dates, alphas, and more information can be found on the game's page on this website.</p>
